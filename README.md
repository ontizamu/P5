# Neighborhood Map

This project was done as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

It features a list of fun places in Chandler, AZ, and a map with map markers showing the location for each place.

##How to run the application

Open index.html. The application consists in a search bar, a list and a map with places to go for fun in Chandler, AZ.

The search bar filters the list and map markers. 

When the user clicks in a map marker, an info window with specific information of that location is opened. 
Some of the information (such as category and contact phone) comes from FourSquare API.

When the user clicks in a list item, an info window is opened too.
